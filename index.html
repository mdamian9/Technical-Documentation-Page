                <p>Greetings everyone! This is a very quick introduction to getting started with GitHub.</p>
                <p>This documentation will go over the very basic steps to creating a project on GitHub, making
                    commits, and deploying
                    to GitHub pages.
                </p>
                <p>In the next sections, we will go over the following:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Creating New Repositories</li>
                    <li>Importing Existing Repositories</li>
                    <li>Making commits to GitHub</li>
                    <li>GitHub Desktop</li>
                    <li>GitHub Deployment</li>
                </ul>
            </section><br>
            <section class="main-section" id="New_Repositories">
                <header>
                    New Repositories
                </header>
                <p>Once you've created a new account on GitHub, you're ready to create your first project.<br>In order
                    to do this, you can click on a button that is found in your account home page. It's a green button
                    that says "New Repository."<br>You'll be able to create a new repository by clicking this button.
                </p>
                <img src="./assets/images/new-repo.png" width="800" height="275" />
                <p>After you've clicked this button you'll now see the following on your screen. Follow the
                    instructions provided.<br> You can name your project and provide a description. You can choose
                    whether your repository is public or private.<br> If you select public, anyone can see your code,
                    but you choose who can make edits to it. If you choose private, only you can see and edit your
                    code.<br> If you'd like to add a README file to your project, you can check the box. Click on
                    "create repository" and you're ready to go.
                </p>

                    Follow the instructions for "... or create a new repository on the command line"<br>
                    Open a terminal window and navigate to the root folder of your project and type in the following:

                    every time to sign in to GitHub.
                </p>
